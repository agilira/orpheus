Orpheus CLI Framework v1.0.6
Released: September 21, 2025

Code Quality and Performance Improvements
- Enhanced sorting algorithm efficiency in help generation
- Improved flag parsing logic with better documentation
- Unified help generation system for consistent output formatting

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

Help Generation Optimization
- Replaced O(nÂ²) bubble sort with O(n log n) sort.Strings() in help.go
- Unified App.GenerateHelp() and HelpGenerator.GenerateAppHelp() for consistency
- App.GenerateHelp() now delegates to HelpGenerator ensuring sorted command output
- Enhanced subcommand sorting performance for better user experience

Flag Parsing Enhancement
- Improved isShortBooleanFlag() implementation with future-ready design
- Added comprehensive documentation for flag parsing limitations
- Enhanced code maintainability with clearer intent and TODO markers
- Better separation between built-in flags and extensible flag detection

Code Documentation and Maintainability
- Enhanced function documentation with performance characteristics
- Added TODO comments for future flash-flags API improvements
- Improved code readability and professional coding standards
- Better separation of concerns between help generation components

PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENTS

Sorting Algorithm Improvement
- Help generation now uses standard library sort.Strings() instead of custom bubble sort
- Significant performance improvement for applications with many subcommands
- Maintained compatibility while improving algorithmic efficiency
- Better scalability for CLI applications with extensive command hierarchies

Consistent Help Output
- All help generation now produces consistently sorted output
- Eliminated discrepancies between different help generation methods
- Improved user experience with predictable command ordering
- Enhanced professional appearance of generated help text

DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE

Code Quality
- Resolved identified inefficiencies in sorting algorithms
