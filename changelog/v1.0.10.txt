• Updated performance metrics with flash-flags v1.1.5 security enhancements
• Preserved 29x-47x performance advantage over major alternatives
• Optimized internal operations with idiomatic Go patternsements
========================================================

Release Date: October 9, 2025
Type: Minor Release (Quality & Documentation)

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

Dependencies:
• Updated flash-flags from v1.1.4 to v1.1.5 for enhanced security
  - Improved input validation and sanitization
  - Enhanced protection against malicious flag values
  - Small performance trade-off (~23% slower) for significant security gains
  - Maintains 29x-47x speed advantage over competing frameworks

Performance:
• Updated benchmarks with flash-flags v1.1.5 impact analysis
  - Orpheus: 634.5 ns/op (was 512.8 ns/op) - acceptable security trade-off
  - Still 29x faster than Cobra, 47x faster than Urfave CLI
  - Memory efficiency maintained: 96 B/op, 3 allocs/op (unchanged)

Code Quality:
• Resolved built-in identifier redefinition warnings
  - Changed parameter name from 'error' to 'message' in addError() function
  - Renamed variable 'copy' to 'result' to avoid built-in function conflict
• Optimized slice copying using built-in copy() function instead of manual loops
  - Improved performance in ValidatedInput deep copy operations
  - More idiomatic Go code following best practices

Documentation:
• Enhanced package-level documentation with clearer feature descriptions
• Updated coverage badge to reflect accurate static percentage (89.8%)
• Fixed example paths in README to point to examples/basic/ (was cmd/demo/)
• Improved GoDoc comments for better API documentation clarity

Project Structure:
• Standardized project layout by moving cmd/demo/ to examples/basic/
• Aligned with Go project conventions for example organization
• Updated all references to use new examples/ structure
