# Orpheus v1.0.8 - Bug Fix Release

**Release Date:** September 22, 2025

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### CLI Execution Flow
- **Fixed help text appearing after successful command execution**
  - Issue: Parent commands with subcommands would show help text after successful subcommand execution
  - Root Cause: `Execute()` method continued execution flow after subcommand completion, leading to help display for parent commands without handlers
  - Solution: Modified `handleSubcommands()` to return execution status, preventing unnecessary help display when subcommand executes successfully
  - Files: `pkg/orpheus/command.go`
  - Impact: Cleaner CLI output, better user experience, no more unwanted help text

### Technical Details
- Modified `handleSubcommands()` signature to return `(bool, error)` instead of just `error`
- Added early return in `Execute()` when subcommand executes successfully
- Maintains backward compatibility for all existing functionality

## üîß Changes Made

```go
// Before: handleSubcommands(ctx *Context, args []string) error
// After:  handleSubcommands(ctx *Context, args []string) (bool, error)

// Before: Help would always show after subcommand execution
// After:  Help only shows when explicitly requested or when no subcommand found
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

- All existing tests pass
- New test scenarios for subcommand execution flow
- Race condition testing with `-race` flag
- Code formatting with `go fmt`
- Static analysis with `go vet`

## üéØ Impact

This release improves the user experience for CLI applications using Orpheus by eliminating unwanted help text output after successful command execution. The fix ensures that:

1. Subcommands execute cleanly without trailing help output
2. Parent command help is only shown when appropriate
3. All existing functionality remains intact
4. Performance characteristics are unchanged

## üîó Integration

This version is particularly important for CLI frameworks that build on top of Orpheus, such as Argus configuration management system, providing a cleaner and more professional command-line experience.
