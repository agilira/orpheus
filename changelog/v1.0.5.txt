Orpheus CLI Framework v1.0.5
Released: September 14, 2025

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CODE EXCELLENCE

Enterprise-Grade Code Quality
- Complete cyclomatic complexity reduction: all functions now under 10
- Comprehensive security analysis with zero vulnerabilities identified
- Full static analysis compliance with enterprise coding standards
- Enhanced error handling using go-errors framework integration

Cyclomatic Complexity Improvements
- Command.Execute() function: Reduced from 14 to <10 (refactored into 5 smaller functions)
  * prepareArgs(): Argument preparation and validation
  * hasHelpFlag(): Help flag detection logic
  * handleSubcommands(): Subcommand routing and execution
  * validateHandler(): Handler validation and error checking
  * parseAndExecute(): Flag parsing and command execution
- help.GenerateCommandHelp() function: Reduced from 13 to <10 (modularized into 3 functions)
  * addCommandUsage(): Usage string generation
  * addSubcommands(): Subcommand documentation
  * addExamples(): Example formatting and display
- Test functions refactored for better maintainability and readability

Security and Static Analysis
- gosec: Zero security vulnerabilities detected across entire codebase
