Orpheus CLI Framework v1.0.4
Released: September 11, 2025

MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS

Production Observability Framework
- Comprehensive observability interfaces for production CLI applications
- Zero-overhead design: 0.24 ns/op when not configured, ~24 ns/op when enabled
- Full OpenTelemetry compatibility with context propagation

Core Observability Interfaces
- Logger: Structured logging with 5 levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error)
  * Context-aware logging with field support
  * WithFields() method for contextual logger creation
  * Native Go context.Context integration
- AuditLogger: Compliance and security audit trails
  * LogCommand() for command execution tracking
  * LogAccess() for resource access monitoring
  * LogSecurity() for security event recording
  * LogPerformance() for operation timing
- Tracer: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry patterns
  * StartSpan() and SpanFromContext() methods
  * Span attribute setting and status management
  * Error recording with configurable options
- MetricsCollector: Application performance metrics
  * Counter, Gauge, and Histogram metrics
  * Label-based dimensional metrics
  * Context-aware metric recording

Field Helper Functions
- StringField(), IntField(), Float64Field(), BoolField(), ErrorField()
- Type-safe field creation for structured logging
- Consistent API across all observability interfaces

Application Integration
- Fluent API: SetLogger(), SetAuditLogger(), SetTracer(), SetMetricsCollector()
- Context methods: Logger(), AuditLogger(), Tracer(), MetricsCollector()
- Nil-safe access patterns for optional observability
- Zero-impact on applications not using observability

PERFORMANCE

Zero-Overhead Design
- 0.24 ns/op overhead when observability not configured
- ~24 ns/op overhead with full observability enabled
- Native Go context performance for correlation
- Optimized interface calls for high-frequency operations

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

Type Safety
- StatusCode enum for span status management
- SpanOption and ErrorOption interfaces for extensibility
- Field struct for type-safe logging parameters

Testing
- Complete test suite with mock implementations
- Performance benchmarks validating zero-overhead claims
- Integration tests with all observability components
- Edge case testing for nil interface handling

Code Organization
- observability.go: Core interfaces and types
- observability_test.go: Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean separation of concerns with optional interfaces

COMPATIBILITY

- Go 1.23+ compatibility maintained
- OpenTelemetry ecosystem integration ready
- Backward compatible - existing applications unaffected
- Production-ready with professional features

This release establishes Orpheus as a professional-grade CLI framework with comprehensive observability capabilities while maintaining its core philosophy of zero dependencies and exceptional performance.
