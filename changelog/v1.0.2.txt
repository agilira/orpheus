## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Core Changes
- **Extended Command struct** with subcommands map and parent pointers
- **Enhanced command execution flow** to handle subcommand routing
- **Added `FullName()` method** for complete command path resolution
- **Subcommand discovery and execution** with proper error handling

### API Additions

- **JSON persistence** for configuration and remotes
- **Real-world patterns** showing practical subcommand usage
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with optimized performance

## ðŸ”§ Backward Compatibility

- **100% backward compatible** with existing Orpheus applications
- **No breaking changes** to existing APIs
- **Existing commands continue to work** without modifications
- **Gradual migration path** for adding subcommands to existing apps

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance

- **Maintains exceptional performance** with subcommand routing
- **Optimized subcommand discovery** with O(1) lookup
- **Efficient help generation** for nested command structures
- **No performance regression** for non-subcommand usage

---

**Migration Guide**: Existing applications require no changes. To add subcommands, simply use the new `Subcommand()` method on existing commands.

**Full Examples**: See `docs/EXAMPLES.md` and `examples/gitlike/` for comprehensive usage patterns.
